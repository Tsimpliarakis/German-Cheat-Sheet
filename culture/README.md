# Culture — Overview

This folder provides cultural context for learners: German history, social norms, everyday life, and customs. Cultural notes help understand register, references, and pragmatic rules.

Files:

- `german-history.md` — a short timeline and historical notes relevant to language and society.
- `politics-and-society.md` — overview of social systems and common political vocabulary.
- `everyday-life.md` — practical cultural insights for living in Germany (shopping, appointments, bureaucracy).
- `customs-and-etiquette.md` — social rules, greetings, and etiquette to avoid misunderstandings.

Use these pages to complement language learning with cultural understanding.
