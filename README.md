A simple and structured collection of notes, examples, and resources to help anyone learning German.
This repository is meant as a quick reference — like a personal textbook — covering grammar, vocabulary, and essential rules.

---

## 🚀 Goal

The goal is not to replace full textbooks but to create a **quick-access reference** for learners who want to review rules, patterns, and common pitfalls without searching across multiple sources.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Everything here is based on learning experiences, grammar books, and resources collected while studying.
- Mistakes might exist — German grammar can be a maze. If you spot any, please let me know.
