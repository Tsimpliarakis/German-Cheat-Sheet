A simple and structured collection of notes, examples, and resources to help anyone learning German.
This repository is meant as a quick reference — like a personal textbook — covering grammar, vocabulary, and essential rules.

---

## 🚀 Goal

The goal is not to replace full textbooks but to create a **quick-access reference** for learners who want to review rules, patterns, and common pitfalls without searching across multiple sources.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Everything here is based on learning experiences, grammar books, and resources collected while studying.
- Mistakes might exist — German grammar can be a maze. If you spot any, please let me know.

### 💡 Tip
If you’re new to German, start with:
1. [Alphabet](https://github.com/tsimpliarakis/german-cheat-sheet/tree/main/alphabet)
2. [Articles & Genders](https://github.com/Tsimpliarakis/German-Cheat-Sheet/tree/main/grammar/articles)
3. [Cases](https://github.com/Tsimpliarakis/German-Cheat-Sheet/tree/main/grammar/cases)

These three are the foundation for almost everything else.
