## 📜 Brief History

German is a **West Germanic language** with roots stretching back to **Proto-Germanic**, the ancestor of languages like English, Dutch, and Swedish. Its development is commonly divided into key historical periods:

* **Old High German (c. 750–1050 AD):** This period began after the **Second Germanic Sound Shift**, resulting in different regional dialects but no standardized written form.
* **Middle High German (c. 1050–1350 AD):** A time of literary flourishing, characterized by epic poetry and courtly romances.
* **Early New High German (c. 1350–1650 AD):** The language began to unify, largely due to **Martin Luther's translation of the Bible (1522)**. His use of a readily understood East Central German dialect was crucial in establishing the basis for today's standardized written language, known as **Standard German** or *Hochdeutsch* (High German).

Today, German is a major global language, holding the distinction of being the most widely spoken native language within the European Union.
