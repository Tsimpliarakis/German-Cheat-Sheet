Contributing
============

Thanks for considering contributing to the German Cheat Sheet!

Please see the repository-level `contributing.md` for guidelines on content formatting, review process, and how to submit changes.

You can open issues or PRs on GitHub. For small fixes (typos, anchors, formatting), a simple pull request that updates the relevant Markdown file is sufficient.
