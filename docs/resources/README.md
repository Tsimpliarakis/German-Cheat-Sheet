> ## 💡 **Tips**
>
> - 🎬 **Always use subtitles** at your level — German subtitles boost listening *and* reading skills together.  
> - 🗣️ **Repeat and shadow** — listen to a sentence and echo it aloud exactly as you hear it.  
> - 🎧 **Mix content types** — combine videos, podcasts, and reading to cover all skills.  
> - 📝 **Track new vocabulary** — use Anki or a notebook to capture and memorize words.  
> - 📚 **Read children’s books** — simple stories make vocabulary and sentence patterns stick.  
> - ⏳ **Stay consistent** — even 15–30 minutes per day with good resources pays off quickly.
