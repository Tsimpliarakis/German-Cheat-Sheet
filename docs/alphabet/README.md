## 2. Special Letters

| Letter | Name (German) | Usage / Pronunciation |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Ä      | ä (Umlaut)    | like 'e' in "bed" or 'ai' in "air" |
| Ö      | ö (Umlaut)    | like 'i' in "bird" (rounded lips) |
| Ü      | ü (Umlaut)    | like French 'u' in "lune" |
| ß      | Eszett / scharfes S | like 'ss' in "kiss" |

> **Note:** ß never appears at the beginning of a word and is often replaced by "ss" in Switzerland.

> ß = ss
---

## 3. Pronunciation Tips

- **Umlauts (ä, ö, ü):** Modify the vowel sound. They are essential because they can change the meaning of a word.
  - Example: *schon* (already) vs. *schön* (beautiful)
- **R:** Can be pronounced differently depending on region — rolled or guttural.
- **V and W:** German V usually sounds like English F; W sounds like English V.
- **Z:** Always pronounced as "ts".
