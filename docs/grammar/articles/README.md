## Overview

German articles are words that accompany nouns and show **gender (Genus)**, **number (Singular/Plural)**, and **case (Kasus)**. They are essential for correct German grammar and change form depending on how the noun is used in a sentence.

There are three grammatical genders in German:
- **der** → masculine (Maskulinum)
- **die** → feminine (Femininum)
- **das** → neuter (Neutrum)

Plural nouns use **die** in the nominative, regardless of gender.

## Types of Articles

- **Definite articles** (bestimmte Artikel): correspond to “the” in English. See [definite.md](definite.md) for details.
- **Indefinite articles** (unbestimmte Artikel): correspond to “a/an” in English. See [indefinite.md](indefinite.md) for details.
- **Negative articles** (Negationsartikel): correspond to “no/not any” in English. See [negative.md](negative.md) for details.
- **No article** (Nullartikel): some nouns appear without any article. See [no-article.md](no-article.md) for details.

## Quick Tips

- Learn articles **with the noun**: *der Tisch, die Lampe, das Haus*.
- Plural definite = always **die** in nominative and accusative.
- Masculine nouns are the most irregular (watch **den** in accusative).
- Feminine is easiest (same form in nominative/accusative and same in dative/genitive).
