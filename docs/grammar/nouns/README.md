# Nouns (Nomen / Substantive)

Nouns are words that represent a person, place, thing, or idea (e.g., *Mann*, *Berlin*, *Tisch*, *Liebe*).

In German, all nouns are **always capitalized**. They also have three key grammatical properties you must learn:

1.  **Gender:** Every noun has a grammatical gender: **Masculine** (*der*), **Feminine** (*die*), or **Neuter** (*das*). This must be memorized with the noun.
2.  **Number (Plural):** Nouns change their form to become plural, using several different endings (e.g., *-n*, *-e*, *-er*, *-s*).
3.  **Case (Declension):** Nouns (and their articles) change form based on their grammatical role in a sentence (the **Case**). This system of changing endings is called **Declension**.
