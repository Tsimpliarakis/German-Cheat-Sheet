# Nouns — Quick reference & study guide

Nouns are the tiny tyrants of German grammar: they demand articles, genders, plural forms and occasional umlauts. This folder organises the essentials so you can stop guessing and start memorising.

## What’s in this folder

- [`cases.md`](./cases.md) — Overview of the four cases (Nominative, Accusative, Dative, Genitive) and how they affect sentence structure.  
- [`declension.md`](./declension.md) — How nouns decline (genitive endings, weak nouns, dative plurals, example tables).  
- [`gender.md`](./gender.md) — Patterns and rules of thumb for masculine/feminine/neuter; common endings and exceptions.  
- [`plurals.md`](./plurals.md) — Plural formation patterns (`-e`, `-er`, `-n/-en`, `-s`, zero-plural, umlaut behaviour) with clean examples.

## At-a-glance reference

### Definite / Indefinite articles (basic)
| Gender | Definite | Indefinite |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Masculine | **der** | **ein** |
| Feminine  | **die** | **eine** |
| Neuter    | **das** | **ein** |
| Plural    | **die** | *(no indefinite article)* |

### Definite articles across cases
| Case | Masc. | Fem. | Neut. | Plural |
|------|-------|------|-------|--------|
| Nominative | **der** | **die** | **das** | **die** |
| Accusative | **den** | **die** | **das** | **die** |
| Dative     | **dem** | **der** | **dem** | **den** |
| Genitive   | **des** | **der** | **des** | **der** |

**Golden rule:** always learn a noun *with its article and plural* — e.g. *der Tisch, die Tische* or *das Buch, die Bücher*.

## How to use these pages (because strategy beats blind memorisation)

1. **Learn nouns with the article and plural.**  
   - Flashcards should show: *der Tisch → die Tische* (not just *Tisch*).  
2. **Group by patterns.**  
   - Practice all `-ung` nouns (usually feminine), diminutives (`-chen`, `-lein` → neuter), etc.  
3. **Use SRS (spaced repetition).** Add gender and plural as separate fields.  
4. **Write 5 sentences** with each new noun (use different cases). This forces declension practice.  
5. **Read and mark**: when you see a noun in a text, mark its gender, plural and case — then check the rules page.

## Common pitfalls (the ones humans trip on)

- Learning nouns without the article. You’ll regret it.  
- Confusing *kein* with *nicht* (see `/grammar/syntax/negation.md`).  
- Assuming plural is predictable — learn the plural with the noun.  
- Expecting natural gender = grammatical gender (e.g., *das Mädchen* is neuter).

## Conventions used in these files

- Example nouns are shown as *article noun* → *article plural* (e.g. *der Hund → die Hunde*).  
- Declension tables show definite-article forms (more useful for beginners).  
- Umlaut changes are described explicitly (e.g. *Apfel → Äpfel*).  
- Relative/compound forms follow the examples in `declension.md`.
