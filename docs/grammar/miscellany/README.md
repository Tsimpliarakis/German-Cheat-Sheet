# Miscellany — Grammar notes

This folder contains short reference notes for smaller grammar topics and helper materials that don't fit into the main sections (articles, nouns, verbs, etc.). The pages are designed to be concise, practical, and easy to reference while studying or writing.

Files

- `adverbs.md` — overview of German adverbs: types, typical word order (Time > Manner > Place), examples, and tips.
- `conjunctions.md` — coordinating, subordinating, and correlative conjunctions with examples and notes on word order.
- `particles.md` — modal, focus, and intensifying particles used in spoken and written German, with examples.
- `prepositions.md` — preposition types and the cases they govern (accusative, dative, genitive, two-way), plus examples.

How to use

- Use these pages as quick references when you need to check a short point (e.g., which case a preposition takes, or typical adverb placement).
- For deeper study, consult the linked sections in the top-level `grammar/` folder or a full grammar textbook.

Contributions

- If you want to expand any page (more examples, exceptions, exercises), create a branch and open a pull request. Keep entries short and example-focused.
