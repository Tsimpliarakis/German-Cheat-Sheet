# Verbs (Verben)

Verbs are the engine of a German sentence. They describe actions (*laufen* - to run), states (*sein* - to be), or processes (*werden* - to become).

Understanding German verbs requires mastering two main concepts:

1.  **Conjugation:** How a verb changes its ending to match a subject (e.g., *ich geh**e***, *du geh**st***).
2.  **Syntax:** Where the verb is placed in a sentence. In German, the verb's position is the most important rule of grammar (e.g., V2 rule, V-Final rule).

This section covers all aspects of how to form, change, and use verbs correctly.
