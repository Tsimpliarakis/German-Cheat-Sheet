# German Syntax (Satzbau)

Syntax is the "architecture" of a sentence—the rules for how to put words in the correct order.

While English has a relatively fixed word order (Subject-Verb-Object), German syntax is more flexible *and* more rigid at the same time. It's flexible because **cases** (Nominative, Accusative, etc.) tell you a noun's job, not its position.

However, it's very rigid about one thing: **the position of the verb**. Understanding where the verb goes is the #1 rule of German sentence structure.

There are three main patterns for the verb:

1.  **Verb-Second (V2):** The conjugated verb is the *second* element in a main clause.
2.  **Verb-First (V1):** The conjugated verb is the *first* element in a yes/no question or command.
3.  **Verb-Final:** The conjugated verb moves to the very *end* of a subordinate clause.

## In This Section

* **[Word Order (Wortstellung)](./word-order.md)**
    An overview of the "V2" (Verb-Second) rule, inversion, and the "TEKAMOLO" rule for ordering information (Time, Cause, Manner, Place).

* **[Main Clauses (Hauptsätze)](./main-clauses.md)**
    A detailed look at simple sentences and the V2 rule, including the "verb bracket" (*Satzklammer*) for modal verbs or the perfect tense.

* **[Conjunctions (Konjunktionen)](./conjunctions.md)**
    The "glue" of the language. Learn the crucial difference between ADUSO (which don't change word order) and subordinating conjunctions (which send the verb to the end).

* **[Subordinating Clauses (Nebensätze)](./subordinate-clauses.md)**
    How to build dependent clauses using conjunctions like *weil* (because) and *dass* (that), forcing the verb to the end (V-Final).

* **[Questions (Fragesätze)](./questions.md)**
    How to form both yes/no questions (V1) and "W-questions" (like *Wer?*, *Was?*, *Wann?*).

* **[Negation (Verneinung)](./negation.md)**
    The complete guide to using **nicht** (not) and **kein** (not a / no) correctly.
