# Adjectives (Adjektive)

Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns (people, places, things, or ideas). In German, adjectives are essential for adding detail and color to your language.

A German adjective can be used in two primary ways:

1.  **Predicate Adjectives:** Used *after* a verb (like *sein* "to be" or *werden* "to become"). This form is simple: the adjective **never** takes an ending.
    * *Das Auto ist **schnell**.* (The car is fast.)
    * *Die Frau ist **freundlich**.* (The woman is friendly.)

2.  **Attributive Adjectives:** Used *before* a noun. This is where German grammar becomes more complex. In this position, the adjective **must** take an ending that matches the noun's gender, case, and number.
    * *Das **schnell<u>e</u>** Auto...* (The fast car...)
    * *Die **freundlich<u>e</u>** Frau...* (The friendly woman...)

Like in English, German adjectives can also be used to compare things.

* *schnell* (fast) -> *schnell**er*** (faster) -> *am schnell**sten*** (fastest)
