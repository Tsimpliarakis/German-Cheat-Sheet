This folder contains concise notes on German adjective usage: how adjectives change form (endings), how they decline with articles and without, and how to form and use comparisons.

Suggested reading order

3. `comparison.md` — study comparatives and superlatives after you understand declension.

Quick tips

- Memorize the strong/weak/mixed distinction and the most common endings for nominative and accusative first.
- Pay special attention to adjective endings after indefinite articles and without articles — these are common sources of mistakes.
- Practice by writing short noun phrases (e.g., "ein guter Mann", "gute Frauen", "rotes Auto") and checking the endings.
