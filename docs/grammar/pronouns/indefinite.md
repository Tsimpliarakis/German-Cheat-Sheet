# Indefinite Pronouns (Indefinitpronomen)

Indefinite pronouns refer to people or things that are not specific. They include words like "someone," "nothing," "everyone," or the general "one."

## 1. `man` (one / you / they)

`man` is one of the most common indefinite pronouns. It refers to a general, non-specific person ("one," "people in general," "you").

* `man` **only exists in the Nominative** and always takes a **3rd person singular** verb (like *er/sie/es*).
* In the accusative and dative cases, it uses the forms `einen` and `einem`.

* **Nom:** *Hier **darf man** nicht rauchen.* (One is not allowed to smoke here. / You can't smoke here.)
* **Akk:** *Stress macht **einen** krank.* (Stress makes one sick. / Stress makes you sick.)
* **Dat:** *Das hilft **einem** sehr.* (That helps one a lot. / That helps you a lot.)

## 2. People: `jemand` / `niemand`

* **`jemand`**: someone, somebody
* **`niemand`**: no one, nobody

These are usually used in the singular. They can decline (add endings) in the accusative and dative, but it's also common to drop the endings in everyday speech.

* **Nom:** ***Jemand** hat geklingelt.* (Someone rang the bell.)
* **Akk:** *Ich habe **niemand(en)** gesehen.* (I saw no one.)
* **Dat:** *Hast du mit **jemand(em)** gesprochen?* (Did you speak with someone?)

## 3. Things: `etwas` / `nichts` / `alles`

These pronouns refer to non-specific things or concepts. They are simple because **they never change their form.** They are always singular and neuter.

* **`etwas`**: something
    * *Ich muss dir **etwas** sagen.* (I have to tell you something.)
    * *Hast du **etwas** Geld?* (Do you have some money?)

* **`nichts`**: nothing
    * *Ich habe **nichts** gehört.* (I heard nothing.)

* **`alles`**: everything
    * ***Alles** ist gut.* (Everything is good.)

## 4. Groups: `alle` / `einige` / `manche`

These refer to groups of people or things and are (mostly) used in the plural. They decline like definite articles in the plural.

* **`alle`**: all, everyone
    * ***Alle** sind hier.* (Everyone is here.)
* **`einige`**: some, a few
    * *Ich habe **einige** Freunde eingeladen.* (I invited a few friends.)
* **`manche`**: some, many a
    * ***Manche** Leute mögen das nicht.* (Some people don't like that.)
