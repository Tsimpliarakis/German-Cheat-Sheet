# Pronomen (Pronouns)

## Introduction

Pronouns replace nouns in a sentence to avoid repetition and indicate relationships.
German pronouns change depending on **person**, **number**, **gender**, and **case (Kasus)**.

There are several types of pronouns, each with a specific job.

> ## ðŸ’¡ **Tips**
>
> 1.  Learn pronouns together with **case endings**; itâ€™s the only way to remember them reliably.
> 2.  Relative pronouns depend on the **case of their role in the relative clause**, not the main clause.
> 3.  The third-person reflexive pronoun (for er, sie, es, sie, Sie) is *always* **sich**.
