# Reflexive Pronouns (Reflexivpronomen)

Reflexive pronouns are used with reflexive verbs. They "reflect" the action of the verb back onto the subject, indicating that the subject is performing the action on or for itself.

They correspond to "myself," "yourself," "himself," "herself," "itself," "ourselves," "yourselves," and "themselves" in English.

Reflexive pronouns only exist in the **Accusative** and **Dative** cases.

## Reflexive Pronoun Declension

| Subject | Accusative | Dative | (English) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ich | **mich** | **mir** | myself |
| du | **dich** | **dir** | yourself |
| **er / sie / es** | **sich** | **sich** | himself / herself / itself |
| wir | **uns** | **uns** | ourselves |
| ihr | **euch** | **euch** | yourselves |
| **sie / Sie** | **sich** | **sich** | themselves / yourself (formal) |

**Key Rule:** The 1st and 2nd persons (ich, du, wir, ihr) use their normal personal pronouns. The 3rd person (er, sie, es, sie, Sie) always uses **sich**.

## When to use Accusative vs. Dative

Most reflexive verbs take the **Accusative**.
* *Ich wasche **mich**.* (I wash myself.)
* *Er rasiert **sich**.* (He shaves himself.)
* *Wir freuen **uns**.* (We are happy / We are pleased.)

You use the **Dative** reflexive pronoun only when the "thing" you are doing the action *to* is a **different** part of your body (which becomes the accusative object).

* **Accusative:** *Ich wasche **mich**.* (I wash myself - *mich* is the direct object).
* **Dative:** *Ich wasche **mir** die Hände.* (I wash my hands - *mir* is the dative "for myself," and *die Hände* is the accusative direct object).

**More Dative Examples:**
* *Putzt du **dir** die Zähne?* (Are you brushing your teeth?)
* *Sie kauft **sich** ein neues Auto.* (She is buying herself a new car.)
