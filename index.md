# German Cheat Sheet

A compact, well-organized reference for learners of German. This site collects concise grammar notes, useful vocabulary lists, practice material, and curated resources — designed for quick lookup and revision.

Quick links

- [Grammar](grammar/README.md) — noun and verb reference, articles, adjectives, pronouns, syntax and more.
- [Vocabulary](vocabulary/README.md) — common words grouped by topic (basics, travel, food, work, etc.).
- [Practice](practice/README.md) — exercises, sample texts, and exam prep materials.
- [Resources](resources/README.md) — recommended apps, books, websites, and channels.

Get the site locally

If you want to run the site locally for preview or contribute content, see the build instructions:

- `docs/BUILDING.md` (local build and serve instructions)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies used by CI and local builds

Contributing

Contributions are welcome — see [Contributing](contributing.md) for guidelines on content, style, and the review process.

Deployment

The site is published to GitHub Pages by a GitHub Actions workflow. The CI builds the site and publishes the `site/` output to the `gh-pages` branch.

Notes

- This is a documentation-first project: the canonical content lives in the `docs/` directory as Markdown files.
- If you run into broken links or missing anchors, run `mkdocs build` locally to catch and fix them before opening a PR.
