Study instructions — how to use this section

1. Start with the essentials (1–2 weeks)
	 - Read `articles/definite.md`, `articles/indefinite.md`, and `nouns/cases.md` to build your foundation.
	 - Practice: pick 20 nouns and write them with article + plural + a sample adjective (e.g., "der kleine Hund - die kleinen Hunde").

2. Build productive grammar (2–4 weeks)
	 - Move to `adjectives/adjective-endings.md`, `verbs/conjugation.md`, and `verbs/tenses.md`.
	 - Practice: write 10 short sentences per day, changing the case and adjective endings.

3. Connectors and complex sentences (ongoing)
	 - Study `syntax/subordinate-clauses.md` and `syntax/word-order.md`.
	 - Practice: transform simple sentences into subordinate clauses (e.g., "Ich weiß, dass..."), and explain why the verb moves to the end.

4. Active recall and spaced repetition
	 - Make flashcards for articles, prepositions with cases, irregular verb forms, and adjective endings.
	 - Use SRS intervals: review new cards after 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks.

5. Practice with authentic material
	 - Find short texts in `practice/sample-texts.md` and mark grammar points from this folder.
	 - Try translating or writing short summaries using the grammar rules you've learned.

Quick study recipes (pick one per study session)
- "10-Minute Drill": choose 5 nouns and decline them in all 4 cases with article and adjective.

- "Reverse Lookup": pick an ending/verb form and find 5 examples in the grammar files.
