# Particles (Partikeln)

Particles are small words that add nuance, emphasis, or emotion to a sentence but do not change its basic meaning. They are common in spoken German and can be tricky for learners.

## Types of Particles

- **Modal particles**: express attitude, mood, or emphasis (e.g., doch, mal, ja, wohl, eben, halt, schon)
- **Intensifying particles**: strengthen or weaken the meaning (e.g., sehr, ganz, ziemlich, nur)
- **Focus particles**: highlight or restrict (e.g., nur, auch, sogar, erst, selbst)

## Examples

- Komm **doch** mit! (Come along, will you!) – modal particle
- Das ist **ja** interessant! (That’s really interesting!) – modal particle
- Ich habe **nur** einen Bruder. (I have only one brother.) – focus particle
- Sie ist **ganz** nett. (She is quite nice.) – intensifying particle

## Notes

- Particles do not change the grammatical structure of a sentence.
- Their meaning often depends on context and intonation.
- Some particles have no direct translation in English.

Learning to use particles naturally will make your German sound more fluent and native-like.
